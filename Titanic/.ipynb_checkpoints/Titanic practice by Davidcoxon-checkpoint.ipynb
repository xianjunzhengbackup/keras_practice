    "# Predicting Titanic Survivers\n",
    "Like Titanic, this is my maiden voyage,  when it comes to Kaggle contest that is!. I've completed the Data Science track on Data Camp, but I'm a relative newbie when it comes to machine learning. I'm going to attempt to work my way through the Titanic: Machine Learning contest. My aim is to submission and initial entry as quickly as possible to get a base line score and then attempt to improve on  on it by first looking at missing data, then engineering key features before establishing a  secondary base line and trying to improve the model itself. I'd like to be able to achieve a score of .80\n",
    "\n",
    "Please feel free to post comments or  make suggestions as to what i may be doing wrong or could maybe do better and  consider upvoting if you find the notebook useful!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this notebook has built up over time I have commented out some of the lines that output files so that when i want to output and test a slight change to the code, i don't output files for bit of the notebook that haven't been changed and that i am not especially intereted in. If you are forking this code you can simple remove the hash and output the file. I have also experimented with different models, so the current model in any stage is not necessarily the most efficent (its just the one that i tried last)."

However after doing some visual data analysis it became obvious that I could use other factors like title to make better estimates on age by simply using the average for people with the same title, the same applied to embarked where average based on fare would give a better estimate and fare based on embarked. \n",

    "Here we are going to manipulate the existing data and try and create new features that our model can use. In some cases this is as simple as changing male and female to numeric data like 0 or 1. We can also separate categorical data to values between 1 and 5 for different titles, alternately we could put each categorical value into its own column, and mark columns with a 0 if they don't apply or a 1 if they do. So features may be quite complex so for example calculating cabin numbers based on surname, and ticket details. "

You might also expect a quite Normal distribution of ages for any given title, but in many cases this doesn't seem to be the case, this is most likely caused by out estimated numbers skewing the data, one way to avoid this would be to use a random number based on the standard deviation in the estimate for each to get a more natural dataset.

    "In this project we have explored the Titanic Data Set, we have identified missing data and filled then as best we could, we have converted categorical data to columns of numeric features that we can use in machine learning and we have engineered new features based on the data we had. We improved our score from base line of 0.57894 to  a score of 0.78.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going from a score of 0.57 to 0.77 was the relatively easy part, taking it from 7.8 to 0.8 is a whole different ball game. Its really temping to overwork the data trying to find new features that might improve the score but in really what you gain in new features you loose in the noise you've introduce, its also tempting to keep tweak the parameters of your model to get the best possible score on the test data, but gain what you gain in performance on the training data you loose in overfitting. A better approach is to stick to the features that have the strongest relationships and ensure that any data that you are estimating or engineering is as accurate as you can possibly make it. Using cross validation to hyper tune the model while minimising any over fitting of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I initially created the project I kept the test and training data completely separate but am I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that combining the two datasets,  is possibly a better approach for estimating missing data based on averages across the entire dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "I  looked at a range of different models and compared the accuracy of each model on the training data before deciding which model to use for the third submission. I then hyper tuned  a hanful of the best performing to ensure that I submitted the best performing hyper tuned model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having hypertuned a single model the next step in my process was to attempt combining several models in an ensemble. I managed to achieve a result of .803 which was OK but not as good as the best hypertuned models that i'd produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "I havn't come any where near winning this contest yet, but I survived my first Kaggle contest and got a score of over .8 which has my goal. The main thing is that I had fun and learnt a lot along the way by trying different techniques and looking at what other people were doing.\n",
